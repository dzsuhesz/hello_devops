A simple, very basic React application.

## Requirements

Node.js for node and npm
-> download node.js and install it
-> install then npm with "npm install" from cmd.exe

## Commands

### `npm start`

Running the code on a dev server (local) without build.
Changes in the code can be seen after reloading.
Good for checking changes immediately.
http://localhost:3000

### `npm run build`

Build and run code from newly created "build" folder in compiled form.

### `npm install -g serve`

Running from the build folder requires an installed static server. This command is for that. URL can be added after "serve".

### `serve -s build`

After previous "npm" command, using this "serve" command will make your page available on the given URL.
